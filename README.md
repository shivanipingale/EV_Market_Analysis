# EV Market Analysis
Conducted an in-depth analysis of the Electric Vehicle (EV) market using **SQL** and **Excel** to uncover trends, sales performance, and adoption patterns. Performed data cleaning, transformation, and querying in SQL, followed by advanced data analysis and visualization in Excel to generate actionable insights.
# Objective
1. Analyzed historical EV sales data to identify market trends and growth patterns.
2. Understand regional adoption rates and key factors influencing EV sales.
3. Leverage data-driven insights to support business and policy decisions.
# Key Learnings
Through this project, I developed strong skills in **SQL for data extraction, cleaning, and querying, along with Excel for data analysis, visualization, and reporting**. I applied trend analysis to identify EV market growth patterns and explored key factors affecting EV adoption, such as infrastructure, consumer preferences. Additionally, I enhanced my ability to derive actionable business insights and make data-driven recommendations for decision-makers.
# Conclusion
The EV market is booming in the automobile sector, driving the shift toward green energy, but several factors influence its overall growth. Based on the analysis, Top Speed (Km/h) has the most significant impact on EV pricingâ€”higher speeds generally correlate with higher prices. Additionally, other factors such as Range, Fast Charging Range, and Acceleration also play a crucial role in shaping EV market trends.
From the data, Tesla has the highest number of models with premium specifications, also Audi, Nissan, Volkswagen stand out next. Also fast charging range (charging with fast chrager) vs range in one charge (normal chrage) varies accross the models and brands, highlighting differences in charging technology and battery efficiency. These insights can help manufacturers focus on optimizing charging efficiency, energy consumption, and affordability to drive greater EV adoption.
